# ZANDVE Enclosed E5+ Printer Code Name: Type V (**Files Loading Soon**)

This mod is is amalgamation of parts from the ZeroG (Mercury1) and Voron (Trident,V1.8,StealthBurner) for the Ender 5 Plus. The primary goal is to provide a enclosed Core-xy printer in similar fashion to Voron design language while still retaining the majority of the E5+ Frame and Z-Motion Systems.

## Description

This version is targeted at anyone looking to retain the **VORON** badging. The **ZERO G** badged version can be found here [Type-Z](https://github.com/Vprince099/ZANDVE/tree/main/Type-Z). In order to provide a version that can be used by the entire E5 Plus community, I am starting with stock Z-Motion (a new upgrade will be released soon to allow for the tri-stepper upgrade Trident by Voron). 

This Version is intended to reduce the cost of conversion while still providing a Fully Enclosed CORE-XY Printer: 

* Estimated Conversion Cost from Stock **TBD**
* Estimated Conversion Cost from Mercury 1/1.1 **TBD**

## Dependencies

* **Please print in ABS or ASA**
* Due to the tight clearances of a part like this, I recommend this part be printed on a properly calibrated printer
* I **Do not** recommend scaling the parts via a slicer as you may have issues with fitment

## Bill of Materials

[BOM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_rfxcacC1YKR7S-sEJu0cIL2j3crcf0YIQrBYNYs7lM/edit?usp=sharing), vendors and other sources will be added as time permits.
