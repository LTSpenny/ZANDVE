# ZANDVE Enclosed E5+ Printer Code Name: Type V (**Under Construction**)

This mod is is amalgumation of parts from the ZeroG (Mercury1) and Voron (Trident,V1.8,StealthBurner) for the Ender 5 Plus. The primary goal is to provide a enclosed Core-xy printer in similar fashion to Voron design language while still retaining the majority of the E5+ Frame and Z-Motion Systems.   

## Description

This Mod is derived from the enclosure project I am currently working on (Jan-2023). In order to provide a version that can be used by the entire Mercury community. I have forked the design and will upload the enclosure version once I am done. This was inspired by the Voron V0. This provides a sturdy solution for tensioning your belt while maintaining a design that allows clearance for an enclosure.  

## Dependencies

* **Please print in ABS or ASA**
* Due to the tight clearances of a part like this, I recommend this part be printed on a properly calibrated printer
* I **Do not** recommend scaling the parts via a slicer as you may have issues with fitment
